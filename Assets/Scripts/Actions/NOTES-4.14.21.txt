-Created new classes for item and enemy stats that allow you to create new enemy databases and objects to store within.
New Objects can be created by RightClicking - Create - Assets and selecting what you wish to create.

-Idea is to make the implementation of custom enemies and (if included) items easier and more standardized.
-Open to suggestions on what stats to include in the current and future data classes.
PLANNED NEXT STEP:
Integrate these data classes with existing scripts - current classes are not implemented into rest of game
and are mainly proof of concepts to test this database method.
