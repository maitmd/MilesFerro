To keep the game small make the parts more general. 
	Upper half (Torso, Arms, Head)
	Lower half (Legs, Feet)
	Weapon. 

This will allow us to have three levels but we can keep them simple 
and small. I think it would be smart to railroad progression to 
keep the experience fast as well. 

Get the Lower half first with whatever challenge and with that
you can complete an easy platformer challenge to get to the upper 
half puzzle/level/fight whatever we decide. 

The lastly combine whatever benefits you get from both to retrieve 
the weapon which should be the most difficult 
to get since it's a weapon maybe and then finally the last fight in 
the basement which if we have time we can implement.

I think we should have one or two us on level design and then the 
other two on gui and functionality stuff. The levels should be simple
so we should be able to finish those before all the technical stuff is 
done and we can speed up progress on that. As for the individual 
levels themselves we can implement the 'keys' and make it so you 
need some things inside the levels to get to the other 'keys' 
though they are less impactful/important.
